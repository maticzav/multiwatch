# MultiWatch


__MultiWatch makes it easier for coaches to track multiple times at one.__

For example, four people start one after another and you want to track the time of each of them sepearately. Normaly you could use two stopwatches and track start times and then finsih times and then calculate differences on your own, but instead you could use MultiWatch which does this all by itself.

>Unfortunatelly, it's not yet possible to track passings of people, so you have to sort them properly.
